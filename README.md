# Config
## How-to
- Make sure to have cloned 3 web-related repos
  - https://github.com/YDCC-Lumiere/config (this)
  - https://github.com/YDCC-Lumiere/website (Go + HTMX iz za fuchure)
  - https://github.com/YDCC-Lumiere/gateway (Because JS ~works in backend~ too)
- Stay at the parent folder, run `docker compose -f ./config/docker-compose.yml up --build`
- Something should appear at `localhost:80`
